### What are some of the best practices while writing a blog?

- Give your blog an interesting title
- Add a table of content for ease of reading
- Explain the chosen topic well
- Add media such as images and videos wherever needed
- Embed links for other blogs, YouTube videos, wikipedia pages etc, wherever needed
- Give a conclusion to your blog

- For example, `This blog is written for the ‚ÄúDevOps" track of CoCode Blogs`.
- Do not forget to add the tag `CocodeBlogs` to your blog for it to be considered a valid entry.
- Lastly, `do not plagiarize`.

### What are the criteria that you look at while deciding winners?

When selecting the best blogs, we look at the following criteria:
- **Interesting introduction**: A captivating introduction that piques the reader's interest and draws them in is essential.

- **Clear explanation**: Your blog's purpose is to explain the chosen topic thoroughly well. Regardless of whether the topic is simple or complex, it's important to present it in a way that is easy for readers to understand.

- **Use of Multimedia**: Incorporating multimedia such as images and videos can provide readers with a broader understanding of the topic. However, be careful not to overload your blog with unnecessary multimedia.

- **Links to external and internal resources**: To aid readers in understanding the topic, consider including links to your own previously written blogs or external resources such as blogs, social media posts, GitHub repositories etc.

- **Concise conclusion**: Summarizing the key points of your blog is crucial. It provides readers with a quick recap of the topic covered.

- **Length of the blog**: While there is no official minimum length for a blog, we recommend having at least 300-400 words. There is no upper limit to how much you can write.

- **Basic grammatical correctness**: You can use free tools like Grammarly to make sure that your blog does not have any grammatical errors.

- **Readability**: The goal is to explain the topic using simple language that is easy for readers to understand.

- **Uniqueness**: While not essential, a unique topic can make your blog stand out from others. In a scenario where two blogs are equally well-executed, the uniqueness of the topic may be a deciding factor.

- **No Plagiarism**: There should be no plagiarism in your blog. Any entry plagiarised above the mark of 20% will be disqualified at once. 

Don't worry if this seems overwhelming at first. Just get started!
